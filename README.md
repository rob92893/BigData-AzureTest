# BigData-AzureTest

The R script generates 1000 random numbers from 0 to 100 and computes the standard deviation and variance.

The R script was executed using a free trial of Microsoft Azure.
First I created a databrick and its associated resource group. Inside that databrick, I created and started a cluster. Then I created a new notebook and wrote the R code in the cells. The first cell defines the function that generates the random numbers and computes the standard deviation and variance. The second cell calls that function. I then attached the notebook to the cluster I made and ran all the cells. When I ran the code, I got a standard deviation of 29.342 and a variance of 860.953.

One of the issues I encountered while
